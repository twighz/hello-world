# hello-world

My first repository on git-hub, which is "empty"

Hello, I am 30 years old and very interested in all kinds of things with computers that have something to do with seeing something, get an idea and make it work. I'm very bad at following a project from A-Z, I always just pick out some part of something and can make it work somehow sometimes but nothing more. 

I hope by trying this thing here, where you "follow trough". Maybe I will be better at my hobby, because even though I love messing with something that has to do with creating something (like platform or make things more simple). I am very bad at it, and not ashamed of it, but since I spend all this time in trying, why not trying it the way I would understand it better rather than just having it barely functional :)
